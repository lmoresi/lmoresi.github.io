Cratons are super-strong regions of the continents that have resisted tectonic
forces for billions of years. How they could be formed in a hot, squishy
early-Earth has been a long-standing puzzle for geologists. Work by Adam Beall,
Louis Moresi and Katie Cooper suggests that cratons were made by the catastrophic switching on of plate tectonics: an event so forceful that such immense stresses were never repeated in the following 3 billion years.

The theory of plate tectonics describes how rigid plates move on the Earth's
surface but this really only applies to the oceanic plates. The continental
crust is generally a great deal weaker and can crumple or stretch in
response to movements of the oceanic plates forming mountain belts, rifts and
low-lying basins.

Some of the oldest parts of the continental crust are an exception to this
generalisation. These are regions that have experienced very little tectonic
deformation in several billion years of existence. These cratons are thought to
represent regions of greater strength and this contributes to their longevity.
There is evidence that the deep lithosphere is as ancient as the crust and is
anomalously thick and buoyant. We also think that the cratons formed from cool,
thin lithosphere in the time before plate tectonics began and then thickened
and strengthened to the point where they became effectively indestructible.

The problem with this idea has always been to explain how the hot, weak
interior of the young Earth could generate enough stress to thicken strong
lithosphere. Alternatively, if the lithosphere was weak too, what stopped it
from falling apart while it cooled and 'hardened' ?

Recent models of the very early Earth showed that the planet could have been
cooling rapidly by heat-pipe volcanism (just like Jupiter's moon Io). Massive
volcanism is enough to prevent plate tectonics from switching on, but when the Earth does cool down enough for the eruptions to slow, a catastrophic transition
begins. Short, violent pulses of lithospheric foundering and overturn occur before
steady plate motions take over.   

Beall and colleagues studied what happens to the strong and buoyant remnants of the heat-pipe lid during these early-Earth hiccups. They found that they became large islands of thick, buckled and very strong lithosphere - exactly like cratons.
Once the model Earth settled down to a more sedate form of steadily moving
plates, the stresses never reached a level that could deform these remnants of
the pre-plate-tectonic state.

      thick, crumpled lithosphere is shuffled around without deformation.
