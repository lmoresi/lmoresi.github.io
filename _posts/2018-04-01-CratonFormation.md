The theory of plate tectonics describes how rigid plates move on the Earth's surface but this really only applies to the oceanic plates.
The continental crust is generally a great deal more squishy and can crumple or stretch in response to movements of the oceanic plates forming
mountain belts, rifts and low-lying basins.

Many of the oldest parts of the continental crust are an exception to this generalisation. These are regions that have experienced very little tectonic deformation
in several billion years of existence. Cratons are thought to represent regions of greater strength and this contributes to their longevity.
There is evidence that the deep lithosphere is as ancient as the crust and is anomalously thick and buoyant.
