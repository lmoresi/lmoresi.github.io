## Shear Bands with Dilantancy

In honour of Hans Mühlhaus' 70th birthday this month, here are some shear band simulations
made with Underworld. We are investigating the role of dilatancy in the geometry of the shear
bands for a box of material when a small trapdoor is opened.

The extent to while large-scale deformation is needed to release material through the trapdoor depends
on how much the material dilates when shear bands form. This is a taster:

We'll be presenting more at the [IWBDG-2017 meeting](http://easyconferences.eu/portfolio/iwbdg-2017/).
