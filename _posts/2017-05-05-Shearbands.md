In honour of Hans MÃ¼hlhaus' 70th birthday this month, here are some shear band simulations
made with Underworld. We are investigating the role of dilatancy in the geometry of the shear
bands for a box of material when a small trapdoor is opened.

The extent to which large-scale deformation is needed to release material through the trapdoor depends
on how much the material dilates when shear bands form. This is a taster:

We'll be presenting more at the [IWBDG-2017 meeting](http://easyconferences.eu/portfolio/iwbdg-2017/).
