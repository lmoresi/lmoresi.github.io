## Research Experience & Expertise

**Geodynamics:** Application of numerical modelling to the dynamics of planetary mantles including effects of rheological variations, partial melting and porous flow of melt. The geological evolution of the Earth, Venus and Mars. Quantitative models of plate tectonics and other modes of planetary evolution. Modelling the dynamics of subduction zones. The deformation of the continental crust at the basin scale and the interaction of tectonics with erosion/sedimentation.

**Computational Mathematics:** The development and application of particle-based finite element methods for high strain, history dependent, fluid and solid deformation problems with interfaces, multiple materials, complicated geometries (e.g. the Underworld code). Advanced solution algorithms for elliptic PDE's using multilevel finite element methods for realistic Earth-like rheology including viscoelasticity, history dependence, anisotropy, and strain-softening plasticity.

**Computational modelling:** Animation, visualisation, capturing the essence of computer simulation for scientific and educational communication. Interactive evolutionary computing as a mechanism for integrating field geology and models. Originator of the CITCOM geodynamics code (1994) which has grown to become a community standard, and the Underworld geodynamics platform..

## Community Software / Algorithms

**CITCOM** — original developer of 3D Citcom for mantle convection studies in 2D and 3D. Over the past 10 years, the global/spherical version of Citcom has become the mostly widely used community code in computational mantle dynamics.

**ELLIPSIS** — particle-in-cell version of Citcom which continues to be used in engineering  / soil mechanics

**UNDERWORLD** — high performance, parallel, version of the Ellipsis algorithm developed as a community code with support from Australian infrastructure funding schemes. Designed for cross-disciplinary applications, this code has enabled many high impact publications.

**GLUCIFER** — visualisation toolkit for particle methods which focuses on efficient transfer of information from simulations running on  remote parallel supercomputers.

**Quagmire** - Quagmire is a collection of parallel algorithms for surface process modelling.
