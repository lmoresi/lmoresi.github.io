I am a professor of geophysics at the Univeristy of Melbourne in Australia. I am interested in understanding the evolution of the deep Earth over geological time, and how this evolution is recorded in the superficial geological record. The tools of my trade are computational models which you can read about on the [Software](http://localhost:4444/pages/Software/) page.

I am a strong supporter of open source code so you will also find links to repositories where the source code is available with examples of how to reproduce peer-reviewed benchmarks and published results. Since I am also a believer in literate programming [1],  recent examples are in the form of ipython / jupyter notebooks.

If you would like to contact me, please be aware that I am delocalised between Melbourne and Los Angeles; email does not always find me quickly and my phone may not work but, please, do try !
